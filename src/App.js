It uses a cold-type virus, engineered to be harmless, as a carrier to deliver a small fragment of the coronavirus to the body.Safely exposing the body to a part of the virus's genetic code in this way allows it to recognise the threat and learn to fight it off, without the risk of becoming ill.After being vaccinated, the body starts to produce antibodies especially tailored to the coronavirus.This means that the immune system is primed to fight coronavirus when it encounters it for real.

They both target the coronavirus's distinctive spike, but use different vectors - the neutralised virus that carries the spike to the body.The idea is that using two different formulas boosts the immune system even more than using the same version twice - and may give longer-lasting protection."

        "The goal of a vaccine program for Covid-19 is not necessarily to get to Covid zero,but it's to tame this virus, to defang it,to remove its ability to cause serious disease, hospitalization, and death.It helps to look at the different outcomes of an exposure to Covid-19 like this: The best-case scenario is, you donâ€™t get sick at all.The worst case is death.In between, thereâ€™s being hospitalized, severe-to-moderate symptoms,or having no symptoms at all.In the absolute best circumstances, vaccines give you protection all the way to here.But realistically, that isnâ€™t the main objective of Covid-19 vaccines.The real purpose is to give your body enough protection to cover these possibilities,so if you do get an infection, it feels more like a cold than something you'd be hospitalized for.And this is one thing that every one of these Covid-19 vaccines do well.Efficacy matters. But it doesnâ€™t matter the most.The question isnâ€™t which vaccine will protect you from any Covid infection,but which one will keep you alive?Or out of the hospital?Which one will help end the pandemic?And thatâ€™s any of them.The best vaccine right now for you is the one that you're offered.With each shot that goes into someone's arm, we get closer to the end of this pandemic."

The trials took place as variants of Covid-19 emerged,and became the dominant infections in these countries variants that are more likely to get participants sick.In South Africa, most of the cases in the Johnson & Johnson trial were that of the variant,not the original strain that was in the US over the summer.And despite that, it still significantly reduced infections.If you're trying to make one-to-one, head-to-head comparisons between vaccines,they need to have been studied in the same trial, with the same inclusion criteria,in the same parts of the world, at the same time."
